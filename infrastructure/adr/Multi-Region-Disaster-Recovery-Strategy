**Title:** Multi-Region Disaster Recovery Strategy
**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-03
### Context
The platform supports critical business workflows that require high availability and resilience against regional failures. Single-region deployments expose the system to risks such as cloud provider outages, network failures, natural disasters, or large-scale misconfigurations. As service count and user dependency increase, downtime in a single region becomes unacceptable.
The platform must be capable of recovering from regional failures while meeting defined recovery objectives and minimizing data loss.
### Decision
Adopt a **multi-region disaster recovery (DR) strategy** for all critical services using managed cloud infrastructure. The strategy is designed to tolerate full regional outages while ensuring predictable recovery behavior.
The platform will follow a **tiered DR model**:
* **Active–Passive** for most services by default
* **Active–Active** for latency-sensitive or mission-critical services where justified
Recovery objectives (RPO/RTO) are defined per service based on business criticality.
### Disaster Recovery Model
**Primary Region**
* Handles all production traffic under normal operation
* Hosts the active Kubernetes cluster and primary data stores
**Secondary Region**
* Maintains warm or hot standby infrastructure
* Receives replicated data continuously or on a defined schedule
* Can be promoted to primary during a regional failure
Traffic routing between regions is managed via global load balancing or DNS-based failover.
### Data Management and Replication
* Stateless services rely on redeployment rather than data recovery
* Stateful components use one of the following strategies:
  * Managed database multi-region replication
  * Asynchronous cross-region backups with point-in-time recovery
* Object storage uses cross-region replication where supported
* Data ownership boundaries defined in ADRs remain enforced across regions
### Recovery Objectives
* **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** Defined per service (e.g., minutes to hours)
* **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** Defined per data store (e.g., seconds to minutes)
Services with strict RPO/RTO requirements must justify active–active deployment via a separate ADR.
### Failover and Traffic Management
* Automated health checks detect regional failures
* Traffic is shifted to the secondary region using:
  * DNS failover
  * Global load balancers
* Manual override mechanisms are required for controlled failover and rollback
### Operational Requirements
* Infrastructure is defined using declarative IaC and replicated across regions
* CI/CD pipelines support region-aware deployments
* Regular DR drills and failover simulations are mandatory
* Runbooks document failover, recovery, and rollback procedures
### Observability and Monitoring
* Cross-region monitoring dashboards are required
* Alerts distinguish between service-level and region-level incidents
* Logs and metrics must remain accessible during regional outages
### Consequences
**Positive:**
* Resilience against full regional outages
* Improved availability and business continuity
* Clear recovery expectations through defined RPO/RTO
* Reduced blast radius of infrastructure failures
**Negative:**
* Increased infrastructure and operational cost
* Added complexity in deployment, testing, and monitoring
* Data consistency challenges in multi-region setups
### Risks and Mitigations
* **Risk:** Data inconsistency during failover
  **Mitigation:** Prefer eventual consistency with clear ownership and reconciliation strategies
* **Risk:** Failover procedures not exercised
  **Mitigation:** Enforce scheduled DR testing and audits
* **Risk:** Cost overruns from idle secondary regions
  **Mitigation:** Use warm standby and scale-on-demand strategies where possible
